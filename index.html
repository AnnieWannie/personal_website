        Hello there and welcome to my website! <br/><br/> 
        My name is Anthony Elia I am a former biologist turned aspiring developer.
        I have always enjoyed and been fascinated by technology; probably due to my love for video games in my youth.<br/><br/> 
        
        I love learning and have been developing and refining my skills through personal projects and problem-solving on leetcode and hackerrank.
        I have knowledge of a variety of languages such as Python, Java, and Javascript. I hope to be able to contribute my skills and talents professionally, but for now 
        I am just learning as much as I can and working on personal projects. <br/><br/>
        Some of my projects are featured and demo'd on this site feel free to check them out, or head over to my <a href="https://github.com/AnnieWannie"><u>github</u></a> and check out everything I have been up to.<br/><br/>

        For any questions or inquiries feel free to reach me using the contact form below.<br/><br/>
        Thanks for stopping by!
